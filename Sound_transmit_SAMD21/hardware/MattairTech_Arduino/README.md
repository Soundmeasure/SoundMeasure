# MattairTech Arduino SAMD Core

This is a fork from arduino/ArduinoCore-samd on GitHub. This will be used to maintain
Arduino support for SAMD boards including the MattairTech MT-D21E and the MT-D11
(see https://www.mattairtech.com/). It primarily adds support for new devices as well
as a more flexible pin configuration / mapping system. It also adds some size
optimizations, including the ability to select any combination of CDC, HID, or UART
through the menu (~7.5KB for blink sketch with CDC+HID+UART, ~2.5KB without USB or UART).

This core is intended to be installed using Boards Manager (see below). To update from a
previous version, click on MattairTech SAMD Boards in Boards Manager, then click Update.

## Special Notes

* **Boards Manager must be opened twice to see some updates**

* **Errors when compiling, uploading, or burning the bootloader**
  * Be sure to install the Arduino samd core before installing the MattairTech samd core. If you have problems upgrading
  the IDE to 1.6.6, you may need to uninstall both the Arduino and MattairTech cores, then re-install in the proper order.
  Use Arduino core 1.6.2 or above.

* **Tools->Communications menu**
  * Currently, the Tools->Communications menu must be used to select the communications configuration. This configuration
  must match the included libraries. For example, when including the HID and Keyboard libraries, you must select an
  option that includes HID (ie: CDC_HID_UART). This menu is currently needed to select the USB PID that matches the
  USB device configuration (needed for Windows). This may become automatic in a future release.

    * Be sure that the Tools->Communications menu matches the sketch and libraries you are compiling.
    * Different combinations of USB devices will result in different COM port assingments in Windows.

* **Incude platform specific libraries**
  * You may need to manually include platform specific libraries such as SPI.h, Wire.h, and HID.h.

* **Differences from Arduino in versioning**
  * The MattairTech ArduinoCore-samd version currently tracks the IDE version. In some cases, it may indicate the
  minimum IDE version. This is the case for both 1.6.5-mtX and 1.6.6-mtX (which corresponds to SAMD CORE 1.6.2).
  1.6.6-mt1 corresponds to Arduino SAMD CORE 1.6.2 plus some pull requests.


## Pin Configurations

Most pins have multiple configurations available (even analog pins). For example, pin A10 on the MT-D21E can be an analog
input, a PWM output, Digital I/O, or the TX pin of 'Serial1'. These always reference the pin number printed on the board
but without the 'A' (with the usable pins starting at 2). DO NOT connect voltages higher than 3.3V!

#### All pins operate at 3.3 volts. DO NOT connect voltages higher than 3.3V!

### Pin Capabilities

* **Digital: All pins can be used for general purpose I/O** 
  * Supports INPUT, OUTPUT, INPUT_PULLUP, and INPUT_PULLDOWN.
  * Each pin can source or sink a maximum of 7 mA (when PER_ATTR_DRIVE_STRONG is set for the pin).
  * Internal pull-up and pull-down resistors of 20-60 Kohms (40Kohm typ., disconnected by default).
  * Use the pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions.
* **Analog Inputs: 10 pins can be configured as ADC analog inputs.**
  * These are available using the analogRead() function.
  * All pins can be used for GPIO and some pins can be used for other digital functions (ie. pwm or serial).
  * Each pin provides 10 bits of resolution (1024 values) by default.
  * 12-bit resolution supported by using the analogReadResolution() function.
  * Each pin measures from ground to 3.3 volts.
  * The upper end of the measurement range can be changed using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function.
* **DAC: One analog output is available on pin 2.**
  * Provides a 10-bit voltage output with the analogWrite() function.
* **PWM: 12 pins (MT-D21E) or 8 pins (MT-D11) can be configured as PWM outputs.**
  * Available using the analogWrite() function.
  * Each pin provides 8 bits of resolution (256 values) by default.

* **AREF: One pin can be configured as an AREF analog input.**
  * The upper end of the analog measurement range can be changed using the analogReference() function.
* **Reset: Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller.**

### MT-D21E and MT-D11 Board Configuration Notes

* The 32.768KHz crystal is used by the Arduino core, so it MUST be connected via the solder jumpers.
* The sketch in some cases can run without the crystal attached, but the clock will be very inaccurate.
* The 16MHz crystal is not used. It should be disconnected via the solder jumpers.
* The I2C (TWI) pullup resistors should be enabled via the solder jumpers.
* The LED should be enabled via the solder jumper.
* Button A and the debouncing capacitor should be connected via the solder jumpers.
* Button B (MT-D21E only) is connected to the Reset pin by default, but can be connected to pin 31 via the solder jumper.
* A reference voltage can be connected to AREF. In this case, the capacitors should be enabled via the solder jumpers.
* On the MT-D11, BTN is shared with SPI SS, so the button must be configured as reset (default) when using SPI.


## Serial Monitor

To print to the Serial Monitor over USB, use 'Serial'. Serial points to SerialUSB (Serial1 and Serial2 are UARTs).
Unlike most Arduino boards (ie. Uno), SAMD boards do not automatically reset when the serial monitor is opened.
To see what your sketch outputs to the serial monitor from the beginning, the sketch must wait for the SerialUSB
port to open first. Add the following to setup():

```
while (!Serial) ;
```

Remember that if the sketch needs to run without SerialUSB connected, another approach must be used.
You can also reset the board manually with the Reset button if you wish to restart your sketch. However, pressing
the Reset button will reset the SAMD chip, which in turn will reset USB communication. This interruption means
that if the serial monitor is open, it will be necessary to close and re-open it to restart communication.


## Code Size and RAM Usage (1.6.5-mt2)

Sketch and Configuration    | MT-D21E (Flash + RAM) | MT-D11 (Flash + RAM)
----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
Blink (CDC + HID + UART)    |     7564 + 1524       |     7452 + 1424
Blink (CDC + UART)          |     6588 + 1496       |     6484 + 1396
Blink (CDC Only)            |     5248 + 1304       |     5192 + 1300
Blink (UART Only)           |     3828 + 336        |     3716 + 236
Blink (No USB or UART)      |     2472 + 144        |     2416 + 140
Datalogger (No USB or UART) |     10340 + 948       |     10260 + 944

* 180 bytes of flash can be saved on the MT-D11 by using PIN_MAP_COMPACT (see 'New PinDescription Table' below).
* Datalogger compiled without USB or UART support, but with SPI and SD (with FAT filesystem) support. Serial output was disabled.
* Note that USB CDC is required for auto-reset into the bootloader to work (otherwise, manually press reset twice in quick succession).
* USB uses primarily 3 buffers totaling 1024 bytes. The UART uses a 96 byte buffer. The banzai() function (used for auto-reset) resides in RAM and uses 72 bytes.
* Any combination of CDC, HID, or UART can be used (or no combination), by using the Tools->Communication menu.


### Detailed Memory Usage Output After Compilation

The flash used message at the end of compilation is not correct. The number shown
represents the .text segment only. However, Flash usage = .text + .data segments
(RAM usage = .data + .bss segments). In this release, two programs are run at the
end of compilation to provide more detailed memory usage. To enable this output, go
to File->Preferences and beside "Show verbose output during:", check "compilation".

Just above the normal flash usage message, is the output from the size utility.
However, this output is also incorrect, as it shows .text+.data in the .text field,
but 0 in the .data field. However, the .text field does show the total flash used.
The .data field can be determined by subtracting the value from the normal flash
usage message (.text) from the value in the .text field (.text+.data). The .bss
field is correct.

Above the size utility output is the output from the nm utility. The values on the
left are in bytes. The letters stand for: T(t)=.text, D(d)=.data, B(b)=.bss, and
everything else (ie: W) resides in flash (in most cases).


## Installation

### Driver Installation

#### Windows

There are currently four USB composite device combinations that include CDC as well as a CDC only device.
Drivers are required for each of these five devices. The CDC only driver is required by the bootloader.
The drivers are signed and support both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows XP (SP3), Vista, 7, 8, and 10.

1. If you do not already have the SAM-BA bootloader installed, see below.
2. Download https://www.mattairtech.com/software/MattairTech_CDC_Driver_Signed.zip and unzip into any folder.
3. Plug in the board while holding down button A to enter the bootloader. The LED should light.
4. Windows will detect the board. Point the installer to the folder from above to install the bootloader driver.
5. If you don't intend on using Arduino, you can skip the rest of this list. See Using Bossac Standalone below.
6. If you do not already have the test firmware installed (comes preinstalled), see Using Bossac Standalone below.
7. Press the reset button to run the test firmware (blink sketch with CDC-HID).
8. Windows will detect the board. Point the installer to the folder from above to install the sketch driver.
9. Continue with SAMD Core Installation below.

#### Linux

0. No driver installation is needed.
1. On some distros, you may need to add your user to the same group as the port (ie: dialout) and/or set udev rules.
2. You MAY have to install and use Arduino as the root user in order to get reliable access to the serial port.
   * This is true even when group permissions are set correctly, and it may fail after previously working.
   * You can also create/modify a udev rule to set permissions on the port so *everyone* can read / write.
3. Continue with SAMD Core Installation below.

#### OS X

1. As of this writing, only the 256 KB chip variants work with the OS X version of the upload tool, bossac.
2. First, you will need to open boards.txt and change mattairtech_mt_d21e_bl8k.upload.tool to equal arduino:bossac.
3. Open platform.txt and change tools.bossac.path to equal{runtime.tools.bossac-1.6.1-arduino.path}.
4. No driver installation is needed. You may get a dialog box asking if you wish to open the “Network Preferences”:
   * Click the "Network Preferences..." button, then click "Apply".
   * The board will show up as “Not Configured”, but it will work fine.
5. Continue with SAMD Core Installation below.

### SAMD Core Installation

* To update from a previous version, click on MattairTech SAMD Boards in Boards Manager, then click Update.
* Boards Manager may require opening twice (with possibly a delay in between) to see some updates.

1. The MattairTech SAMD Core requires Arduino 1.6.6+ (1.6.5-mtX required IDE 1.6.5).
2. In the Arduino IDE, click File->Preferences.
3. Click the button next to Additional Boards Manager URLs.
4. Add https://www.mattairtech.com/software/arduino/package_MattairTech_index.json.
5. Save preferences, then open the Boards Manager.
6. Install the Arduino SAMD Boards package. Use version 1.6.2 or higher with 1.6.6-mtX.
7. Install the MattairTech SAMD Boards package (1.6.6-mtX).
8. Close Boards Manager, then click Tools->Board->MattairTech MT-D21E (or MT-D11).
9. Select the processor with the now visible Tools->Processor menu.
10. If you do not already have the bootloader or blink sketch installed, see SAM-BA USB CDC Bootloader below.
11. Plug in the board. The blink sketch should be running.
12. Click Tools->Port and choose the COM port.
13. You can now upload your own sketch.


## SAM-BA USB CDC Bootloader (Arduino compatible)

The SAM-BA bootloader has both a CDC USB interface, and a UART interface (MT-D21E: TX: pin 10, RX: pin 11). It is
compatible with the Arduino IDE (Zero compatible), or it can be used with the Bossac tool standalone. Under
Arduino, auto-reset is supported (automatically runs the bootloader while the sketch is running) as well as
automatic return from reset. The SAM-BA bootloader described here adds to the Arduino version, which in
turn is based on the bootloader from Atmel. The Arduino version added several features, including three
new commands (Arduino Extended Capabilities) that increase upload speed. The bootloader normally requires
8 KB FLASH, however, a 4 KB version can be used for the D11 chips.

Bossac is a command line utility for uploading firmware to SAM-BA bootloaders. It runs on Windows. Linux, and OS X.
It is used by Arduino to upload firmware to SAM and SAMD boards. The version Bossac described here adds to the
Arduino version (https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA, Arduino branch), which in turn is a fork from the original
Bossa (http://www.shumatech.com/web/products/bossa). It adds support for more SAMD chips (both D21 and D11).

Note that only the Arduino or Mattairtech versions of bossac are currently supported for SAMD chips.
Neither the stock bossac (or Bossa) nor the Atmel SAM-BA upload tool will work.

Arduino Extended Capabilities:

   * X: Erase the flash memory starting from ADDR to the end of flash.
   * Y: Write the content of a buffer in SRAM into flash memory.
   * Z: Calculate the CRC for a given area of memory.

The bootloader can be started by:

   * Tapping reset twice in quick succession (BOOT_DOUBLE_TAP).
   * Holding down button A (BOOT_LOAD_PIN) while powering up.
   * Clicking 'Upload Sketch' in the Arduino IDE, which will automatically start the bootloader.
   * If the application (sketch) area is blank, the bootloader will run.

Otherwise, it jumps to application and starts execution from there. The LED will light during bootloader execution.
Note that the 4KB bootloader does not support the Arduino Extended Capabilities or BOOT_DOUBLE_TAP.
However, BOOT_DOUBLE_TAP does fit into the SAMD11 4KB bootloader.

When the Arduino IDE initiates the bootloader, the following procedure is used:

1. The IDE opens and closes the USB serial port at a baud rate of 1200bps. This triggers a “soft erase” procedure.
2. The first row of application section flash memory is erased by the MCU. If it is interrupted for any reason, the erase procedure will likely fail.
3. The board is reset. The bootloader (which always runs first) detects the blank flah row, so bootloader operation resumes.
4. Opening and closing the port at a baud rate other than 1200bps will not erase or reset the SAMD.

2. Plug an Atmel ICE into USB, then connect it to the powered SAMD board. A green LED should light on the Atmel ICE.
3. Click Tools->Programmer->Atmel ICE.
4. Click Tools->Board->MattairTech MT-D21E (or MT-D11).
5. Click Tools->Burn Bootloader. Ignore any messages about not supporting shutdown or reset.
6. Continue with driver installation above.

#### Bootloader Installation Using Another Tool (ie: Atmel Studio, openocd)

1. Download the bootloader from https://www.mattairtech.com/software/arduino/SAM-BA-bootloaders-zero-mattairtech.zip.
2. Unzip to any directory. Be sure that a bootloader is available for your particular chip.
3. Follow the procedures for your upload tool to upload the firmware.
   * Perform a chip erase first. Be sure no BOOTPROT bits are set.
   * Install the binary file to 0x00000000 of the FLASH.
   * You can optionally set the BOOTPROT bits to 8KB (or 4KB for the MT-D11). The Arduino installation method does not set these.
   * You can optionally set the EEPROM bits or anything else. The Arduino installation method uses factory defaults.
4. Continue with driver installation above.

### Using Bossac Standalone

When using Bossac standalone, you will need to ensure that your application starts at 0x00002000 for 8 KB bootloaders,
and 0x00001000 for 4 KB bootloaders. This is because the bootloader resides at 0x00000000. This can be accomplished
by passing the following flag to the linker (typically LDFLAGS in your makefile; adjust for your bootloader size):

```
Wl,sectionstart=.text=0x2000
```

You may also use a linker script. See the MattairTech SAMD package for examples.
Be sure to generate and use a binary file. Many makefiles are set up to generate an elf, hex, and bin already.

Download Bossac from:

* https://www.mattairtech.com/software/arduino/bossac-1.5-arduino-mattairtech-1-mingw32.zip (Windows 32 bit and 64 bit)
* https://www.mattairtech.com/software/arduino/bossac-1.5-arduino-mattairtech-1-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 (Linux 64 bit)
* https://www.mattairtech.com/software/arduino/bossac-1.5-arduino-mattairtech-1-i686-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 (Linux 32 bit)
* Use the bossac command from the Arduino SAMD package for OS X support. Only the 256 KB chip versions are supported

As an example, bossac will be used to upload the test firmware (blink sketch):

1. Download firmware from https://www.mattairtech.com/software/SAM-BA-bootloader-test-firmware.zip and unzip.
2. If you have not already installed the bootloader driver, see Driver Installation above.
3. Be sure there is a binary that matches your chip. On the command line (change the binary to match yours):
4. On Linux --port might be /dev/ttyACM0. If the device is not found, remove the --port argument for auto-detection.

```
bossac.exe -d --port=COM5 -U true -i -e -w -v Blink_Demo_ATSAMD21E18A.bin -R
```
5. See http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/vivid/man1/bossac.1.html for details.
6. Continue with the CDC-HID driver installation above (optional).



## New PinDescription Table

```
/*   The PinDescription table describes how each of the pins can be used by the Arduino
 *   core. Each pin can have multiple functions (ie: ADC input, digital output, PWM,
 *   communications, etc.), and the PinDescription table configures which functions can
 *   be used for each pin. This table is mainly accessed by the pinPeripheral function in
 *   wiring_private.c, which is used to attach a pin to a particular peripheral function.
 *   The communications drivers (ie: SPI, I2C, and UART), analogRead(), analogWrite(),
 *   analogReference(), attachInterrupt(), and pinMode() all call pinPeripheral() to
 *   verify that the pin can perform the function requested, and to configure the pin for
 *   that function. Most of the contents of pinMode() are now in pinPeripheral().
 * 
 *   There are two ways that pins can be mapped. The first is to map pins contiguously
 *   (no PIO_NOT_A_PIN entries) in the table. This results in the least amount of space
 *   used by the table. A second method, used by default by the MT-D21E and MT-D11, maps
 *   Arduino pin numbers to the actual port pin number (ie: Arduino pin 28 = Port A28).
 *   This only works when there is one port. Because not all port pins are available,
 *   PIO_NOT_A_PIN entries must be added for these pins and more FLASH space is consumed.
 *   For an example of both types, see variant.cpp from the MT-D11 variant.
 * 
 *   Explanation of PinDescription table:
 * 
 *   Port                  This is the port (ie: PORTA).
 *   Pin                   This is the pin (bit) within the port. Valid values are 0-31.
 *   PinType               This indicates what peripheral function the pin can be
 *                         attached to. In most cases, this is PIO_MULTI, which means
 *                         that the pin can be anything listed in the PinAttribute field.
 *                         It can also be set to a specific peripheral. In this case, any
 *                         attempt to configure the pin (using pinPeripheral or pinMode)
 *                         as anything else will fail (and pinPeripheral will return -1).
 *                         This can be used to prevent accidental re-configuration of a
 *                         pin that is configured for only one function (ie: USB D- and
 *                         D+ pins). If a pin is not used or does not exist,
 *                         PIO_NOT_A_PIN must be entered in this field. See WVariant.h
 *                         for valid entries. These entries are also used as a parameter
 *                         to pinPeripheral() with the exception of PIO_NOT_A_PIN and
 *                         PIO_MULTI. The pinMode function now calls pinPeripheral() with
 *                         the desired mode. Note that this field is not used to select
 *                         between the two peripherals possible with each of the SERCOM
 *                         and TIMER functions. PeripheralAttribute is now used for this.
 *   PeripheralAttribute   This is an 8-bit bitfield used for various peripheral
 *                         configuration. It is primarily used to select between the two
 *                         peripherals possible with each of the SERCOM and TIMER
 *                         functions. TIMER pins are individual, while SERCOM uses a
 *                         group of two to four pins. This group of pins can span both
 *                         peripherals. For example, pin 19 (SPI1 SCK) on the MT-D21E
 *                         uses PER_ATTR_SERCOM_ALT while pin 22 (SPI1 MISO) uses
 *                         PER_ATTR_SERCOM_STD. Both TIMER and SERCOM can exist for each
 *                         pin. This bitfield is also used to set the pin drive strength.
 *                         In the future, other attributes (like input buffer
 *                         configuration) may be added. See WVariant.h for valid entries.
 *   PinAttribute          This is a 32-bit bitfield used to list all of the valid
 *                         peripheral functions that a pin can attach to. This includes
 *                         GPIO functions like PIN_ATTR_OUTPUT. Certain attributes are
 *                         shorthand for a combination of other attributes.
 *                         PIN_ATTR_DIGITAL includes all of the GPIO functions, while
 *                         PIN_ATTR_TIMER includes both PIN_ATTR_TIMER_PWM and
 *                         PIN_ATTR_TIMER_CAPTURE (capture is not used yet).
 *                         PIN_ATTR_ANALOG is an alias to PIN_ATTR_ANALOG_ADC. There is
 *                         only one DAC channel, so PIN_ATTR_DAC appears only once. This
 *                         bitfield is useful for limiting a pin to only input related
 *                         functions or output functions. This allows a pin to have a
 *                         more flexible configuration, while restricting the direction
 *                         (ie: to avoid contention). See WVariant.h for valid entries.
 *   TCChannel             This is the TC(C) channel (if any) assigned to the pin. Some
 *                         TC channels are available on multiple pins (ie: TCC0/WO[0] is
 *                         available on pin A4 or pin A8 on the MT-D21E). In general,
 *                         only one pin should be configured (in the pinDescription
 *                         table) per TC channel. See WVariant.h for valid entries.
 *                         The tone library uses TC5 (MT-D21E) or TC2 (MT-D11).
 *   ADCChannelNumber      This is the ADC channel (if any) assigned to the pin. See
 *                         WVariant.h for valid entries.
 *   ExtInt                This is the interrupt (if any) assigned to the pin. Some
 *                         interrupt numbers are available on multiple pins (ie:
 *                         EIC/EXTINT[2] is available on pin A2 or pin A18 on the
 *                         MT-D21E). In general, only one pin should be configured (in
 *                         the pinDescription table) per interrupt number. Thus, if an
 *                         interrupt was needed on pin 2, EXTERNAL_INT_2 can be moved
 *                         from pin 18. See WVariant.h for valid entries.
